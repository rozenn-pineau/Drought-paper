# Ancestry mapping using ancestry hmm

## Processing results from ancestry_hmm output

Ancestry_hmm gives as an output one file per sample, that has the following header :
```
chrom	position	2,0,0	1,1,0	1,0,1	0,2,0	0,1,1	0,0,2
```
"2,0,0" column has the probability that the loci was homozygote for var. tuberculatus before hybridization, and stayed homozygote for var. tuberculatus at pulse 2 and 3 (0 chromosomes from var. rudis). GT = 0
"1,1,0" column has the probability that the loci was heterozygote for var. tuberculatus before hybridization, and became heterozygote for var. rudis at pulse 2 (1 chromosome from var. rudis). GT = 1
"1,0,1" column has the probability that the loci was heterozygote for var. tuberculatus before hybridization, and became heterozygote for var. rudis at pulse 3 (1 chromosome from var. rudis). GT = 1
"0,2,0" column has the probability that the loci was homozygote for var. rudis before hybridization, and stayed homozygote for var. rudis (0 chromosome from var. tuberculatus). GT = 2
"0,1,1" column has the probability that the loci was homozygote for var. tuberculatus before hybridization, and became gain one var. rudis loci at each pulse (1 chromosome from var. rudis). GT = 2
"0,0,2" column has the probability that the loci was homozygote for var. rudis before hybridization, and became homzygote for var. rudis at pulse 3 (1 chromosome from var. rudis). GT = 2

The probabilitiees in the columns add up to 1. 

We choose a threshold of 0.9 to assign ancestry at each site using the following script. 


### Step (1) : gather all samples in one file

```
#!/bin/bash

folder_name=$(basename "$PWD")
output_file="${folder_name}_values.txt"

#initialize dataset with chrom and pos
awk 'BEGIN { OFS="\t" } {print $1,$2}' P11_Ag_11_T.posterior > $output_file

#loop through each individual and paste information to previous version of the file
for file in *.posterior; do

    header_name=$(basename "$file" .posterior)
    
    awk -v header="$header_name" 'NR == 1 { print header; }
    
    NR > 1 {
    
    result = "NA";
    if ($3 > 0.9) result = "0";
    else if ($4 > 0.9) result = "1";
    else if ($5 > 0.9) result = "1";
    else if ($6 > 0.9) result = "2";
    else if ($7 > 0.9) result = "2";
    else if ($8 > 0.9) result = "2";
    print result;
    }' $file > tmp
    
    paste $output_file tmp > tmp2
    
    mv tmp2 $output_file

done

#check: file is 786262 lines and 284 columns (chromosome, position and 282 individuals).

```

### Visualize : plot ancestry by chromosome in R

We used the following script [plot_ancestry.R](https://github.com/rozenn-pineau/Drought-paper/blob/main/plot_ancestry.R) to visualize ancestry per chromosome for each smaple in the dataset, ordered by longitude. 


# GWAS on ancestry calls

## (1) Using a "manual" logistic model with and without covariate

We ran logistic regression model in R based on the ancestry calls and using PC1 as a covariate using the following R scripts : without covariate - [gwas_ancestry_logistic_v2.R](https://github.com/rozenn-pineau/Drought-paper/blob/main/gwas_ancestry_logistic_v2.R) and with covariate - [gwas_ancestry_logistic_covariate_v2.R](https://github.com/rozenn-pineau/Drought-paper/blob/main/gwas_ancestry_logistic_covariate_v2.R).
These scripts require the sample order vector ("samp_order_noout.txt"), the phenotypes ("drought_phenos.txt") and the PC information ("PCA_output_noout.txt").


## (2) using GEMMA with and without relatedness matrix
